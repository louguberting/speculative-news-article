# Speculative-Blog-Post

For the Understanding Culture for Design course at Singapore University of Technology and Design we were challenged to imagine a speculative future and design a product for a user group in that future.

My team decided to create embodied learning experiences for university students in 2035. For this project, we also needed to create artifacts from this speculative future. This project represents a blog post by someone critical of product our team is creating.

This blog post is fictional and any resemblance to real people is a coincidence.
